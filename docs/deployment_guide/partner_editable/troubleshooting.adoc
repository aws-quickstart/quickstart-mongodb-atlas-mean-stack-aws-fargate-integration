// Add any unique troubleshooting steps here.

For troubleshooting common Partner Solution issues, refer to the https://fwd.aws/rA69w?[AWS Partner Solution General Information Guide^] and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting CloudFormation^].

Errors can typically be resolved by inspecting the CloudFormation event logs or CloudWatch logs created by the MongoDB Atlas CloudFormation resources.

If a stack fails to deploy, check the *Events* tab. If the error occurs for one of the MongoDB Atlas resources (for example, MongoDB::Atlas::Cluster), you will find a corresponding Amazon CloudWatch Logs group called *mongodb-atlas-cluster-logs*. Locate this group, and check the latest log entry to identify the issue.

=== FAQ

//TODO These two FAQs will be removed when Partner Solution is updated to use public registry resources
*Q.* Do I need to run the *RegisterMongoDBResource* step each time?

*A.* No. You must run this step only once per Region.

*Q.* What does the *RegisterMongoDBResource* step do?

*A.* It registers each of the MongoDB Atlas CloudFormation resource types. This is a standard requirement for CloudFormation. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-custom-resources.html[Custom resource^].
