For troubleshooting common Partner Solution issues, refer to the https://fwd.aws/rA69w?[AWS Partner Solution General Information Guide^] and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting CloudFormation^].

Errors can typically be resolved by inspecting the CloudFormation event logs or CloudWatch logs created by the MongoDB Atlas CloudFormation resources.

If a stack fails to deploy, check the *Events* tab. If the error occurs for one of the MongoDB Atlas resources (for example, MongoDB::Atlas::Cluster), you will find a corresponding Amazon CloudWatch Logs group called *mongodb-atlas-cluster-logs*. Locate this group, and check the latest log entry to identify the issue.
