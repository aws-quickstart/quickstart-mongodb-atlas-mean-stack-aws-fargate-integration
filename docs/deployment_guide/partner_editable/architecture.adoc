As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A virtual private cloud (VPC) for the MongoDB Atlas project that spans at least three Availability Zones. This includes a fully managed MongoDB Atlas cluster and a database user.
* An AWS PrivateLink connection between your VPC and the MongoDB Atlas VPC.
* A VPC that spans two Availability Zones. The VPC is configured with public subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.
* In the public subnets, managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access.
** An Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) task and service with the AWS Fargate launch type for the containerized Angular client application using the user-provided Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) image URI.
** An AWS Cloud Map entry for the service discovery.
** An Amazon ECS task and service with the Fargate launch type for the containerized server application using the user-provided Amazon ECR image URI.
** An Application Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic to client applications.
* An AWS Cloud Map to create a private namespace based on Domain Name Service (DNS), which will be visible only inside the specified Amazon VPC.
* Amazon ECR for storing images for client and server applications.
* Fargate to run your containerized applications without the need to provision and manage the underlying infrastructure.
