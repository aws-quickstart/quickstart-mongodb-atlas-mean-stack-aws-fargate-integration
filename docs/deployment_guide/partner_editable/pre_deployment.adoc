== Predeployment steps

=== Prepare your AWS account

This Partner Solution uses MongoDB Atlas CloudFormation resource types and automatically registers them in the AWS Region of your choice. Also, it uses Amazon Fargate(ECS) services.

=== Prepare your {partner-company-name} account

A MongoDB Atlas programmatic API key must be generated with the appropriate permissions and network access entries so that AWS CloudFormation can successfully authenticate the MongoDB cloud. For more information about creating and managing API keys, see https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/manage-programmatic-access[Programmatic Access to Atlas^].
