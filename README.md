Application Modernization with MongoDB Atlas and AWS Fargate:

This demo demonstrates an end to end serverless application architected to scale for production, using MEAN Stack with Atlas and AWS Fargate services. The MEAN stack application is containerized and deployed to AWS Fargate as a single click deployment. This will benefit the startup enterprises to transform their ideas to an application at ease, secured and at scale.

This Quick Start provisions complete MongoDB Atlas MEAN Stack AWS Fargate deployments through CloudFormation using official MongoDB Atlas AWS CloudFormation Resource Types.

## Architecture

   - Instance size,  Database Name,  Database Username and Password.
   - Client and Server ECR Image
* AWS Network Configuration
   - VPC Cidr and subnets cidr



### Launch the quickstart stack using AWS CloudFormation

The `templates/quickstart_Fargate_V2.yaml` template will
provision a complete MongoDB Atlas MEAN Stack AWS Fargate Deployment for you. Based on your requirement you can select parameters for MongoDBAtlas cluster, database and AWS network confguration. 

Using AWS CLI.

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy --stack-name STACK_NAME --template-body quickstart_Fargate_V2.yaml
```

This includes the follow resources:
* [MongoDB::Atlas::Project](/cfn-resources/project)
* [MongoDB::Atlas::ProjectIpAccessList](/cfn-resources/project-ip-access-list) 
* [MongoDB::Atlas::Cluster](/cfn-resources/cluster)
* [MongoDB::Atlas::DatabaseUser](/cfn-resources/database-user) 
    * Includes AWS IAM Role Integration 
* AWS Fargate(ECS)
    * Includes 'ClientTaskExecutionRole' and 'ServerTaskExecutionRole' roles


Please make sure to provide correct parameters including ECR images for client and server applications in `templates/quickstart_Fargate_V2.yaml`.
